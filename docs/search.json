For example you should know if a variable is linearly proportional or inversely proportional to another variable (a possible multiple-choice question) and what the constant of proportionality is called (a possible short-answer question). You should have some ideas about the typical range of variables in the atmosphere and the order of magnitude of constants rather than their exact value.\n\n\nCan I use a calculator?\nYes, although the questions are designed to be completed without needing one.\nWhich equations should I focus on?\n\nEnergy fluxes at Earth’s surface – ideal surface: \\(Q* = Q_{H} + Q_{E} + Q_{G}\\) (Topic 3)\nCosine law of illumination: \\(S = S_{i}cosZ\\) (Topic 4)\nConservation of incident radiation: \\(\\psi_{\\lambda} + \\alpha_{\\lambda} + \\zeta_{\\lambda} = 1\\) (Topic 5 & 7)\nSpectral reflectivity: \\(\\alpha_{\\lambda}\\) = Radiation reflected/Radiation incident (Topic 6)\nAlbedo: = \\(K\\uparrow/K\\downarrow\\)\nStefan-Boltzmann’s law: \\(E = \\sigma T_{0}^{4}\\) (and \\(E = \\sigma \\varepsilon T_{0}^{4}\\)) (Topic 7)\nKirchhoff’s law: \\(\\zeta_{\\lambda} = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}\\) (Topic 7)\nNet longwave radiation: \\(L* = L\\downarrow - L\\uparrow = L\\downarrow - (\\varepsilon_{o}T_{o}^{4} +(1-\\varepsilon_{o}))L\\downarrow)\\) (Topic 8)\nNet (absorbed) solar: \\(K* = K\\downarrow - K\\uparrow = K\\downarrow(1 -\\alpha)\\) (Topic 8)\nNet all-wave radiation: \\(Q* = K* + L * = K\\downarrow(1 -\\alpha) + \\varepsilon_{o}L\\downarrow - \\varepsilon_{o}T_{o}^{4}\\) (Topic 8)\nThe heat capacity of a mixture: \\(C_{s} = C_{m}\\theta_{m}+C_{o}\\theta_{o}+C_{w}\\theta_{w}+C_{a}\\theta_{a}\\) (Topic 10)\nRate of temperature change in a soil: \\(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{C_{s}}\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta z}\\) (Topic 10)\nFourier’s law: \\(Q_{G} = -k\\Delta T/\\Delta z = -k(T_{2}-T_{1})/(z_{2}-z_{1})\\) (Topic 10 & 11)\nThermal diffusivity: \\(\\kappa = k/C\\) (Topic 10)\nThermal admittance: \\(\\mu = (kC)^{1/2}\\) (Topic 11)\nDamping depth: \\(D=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\omega}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa P}{\\pi}}\\) (Topic 12)\nBeer’s law: \\(I_{\\lambda(z)} = I_{\\lambda(o)}e^{-kz}\\) (Topic 13)\nThe energy balance of snow and ice: \\(Q* = Q_{H} + Q_{s} + Q_{M}\\)\nSensible heat flux through LBL: \\(Q_{H} = C_{a}(T_{0} -T_{a})/r_{b}\\) (Topic 15)\nWater vapour flux through LBL: \\(Q_{E} = L_{v}(\\rho_{vo}-\\rho_{va})/r_{b}\\) (Topic 15)\nReynold’s number: \\(Re = \\frac{\\mu d}{\\nu}\\) (Topic 16)\nReynold’s decomposition: \\(a(t) = a'(t) - \\overline{a}\\) (Lecture 18)\nThe variance of \\(a\\) (variable of interest) in a turbulent time series: \\(\\overline{a^{'2}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i = 0}^{N-1}{a^{'2}(t_{i},x_{0})}\\) (Lecture 18)\nThe standard deviation of a (variable of interest) in a turbulent time series: \\(\\sigma_{a} = \\sqrt{\\overline{a^{'2}}}\\)\nTurbulence intensities: (Lecture 18) \\(I_{u} = \\sigma_{u}/M\\) \\(I_{v} = \\sigma_{v}/M\\) \\(I_{w} = \\sigma_{w}/M\\) \\(M = \\sqrt{\\overline{u}^{2}+\\overline{v}^{2}+\\overline{w}^{2}}\\)\nReynolds stress: \\(\\tau = -\\rho{\\overline{u'w'}}\\) (Lecture 19)\nFriction velocity: \\(u_{*} = \\sqrt{-\\overline{u'w'}}\\) (Lecture 19)\nThe logarithmic wind law: \\(\\overline{u}_{(z)} = \\frac{u_{*}}{k}ln\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\) or if we include the zero-plane displacement (\\(z_{d}\\)) \\(\\overline{u}_{(z)} = \\frac{u_{*}}{k}ln\\frac{z-z_{d}}{z_{0}}\\) (Lecture 20)\nEstimate of the roughness length (\\(z_{0}\\)): \\(z_{0} \\approx 0.1z_{h}\\) (Lecture 20)\nFlux-gradient equations (i.e., K-theory) for momentum flux density: \\(\\tau = \\rho K_{m} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z}\\), Water vapour flux density: \\(E = K_{V} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho_{v}}}{\\partial z}\\), sensible heat flux density: \\(Q_{H} = C_{a} K_{H} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta}}{\\partial z}\\), trace gas flux density: \\(F_{c} = K_{c} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\rho_{c}}}{\\partial z}\\) (Lecture 21)\nReynold’s analogy: \\(K_{M} = K_{H} = K_{V} = K_{C}\\) (Lecture 21)\nSensible heat flux density measured via eddy covariance: \\(Q_{H} = \\rho c_{p} \\overline{w'T'}\\) (Lecture 22)\nLatent heat flux density measured via eddy covariance: \\(Q_{E} = L_{v} \\overline{w' \\rho_{v}'}\\) (Lecture 22)\nTrace gas flux density measured via eddy covariance: \\(F_{c} = \\overline{w' \\rho_{c}'}\\) (Lecture 22)\nGradient Richardson number: \\(R_{i} = \\frac{g}{\\overline{T}} \\frac{\\Delta \\overline{\\theta}/\\Delta z}{(\\Delta \\overline{u}/\\Delta z)^{2}}\\) (Lecture 23)\nLand-atmosphere water balance: \\(P = E + I + \\Delta R + \\Delta S\\) (Lecture 29)\nWater balance of plant canopies: \\(P = P_{T} + P_{S} + P_{I}\\) (Lecture 29)\nNet ecosystem productivity: NEP = GPP-ER (Lecture 30)\nEcosystem respiration: ER = AR + HR (Lecture 30)\nPenman model for evapotranspiration: \\(Q_{E} = \\frac{s}{s + \\gamma}(Q^{*} - Q_{G}) + \\frac{C_{a} (vdd_{a} / r_H)}{s + \\gamma}\\) (Lecture 31)\n\n\n\nAre there examples from previous years?\nYes.

    "text": "Here are some R basics that will help you get started with Study Questions and Assignments.\nMuch of this is adpated from http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/easy-r-programming-basics\n\nR can be used as a calculator.\nThe basic arithmetic operators are:\n\n+ (addition)\n- (subtraction)\n* (multiplication)\n/ (division)\nand ^ (exponentiation).\n\nType directly the command below in the console:\n\n# Addition\n3 + 7\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n# Multiplication\n3 * 7\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\n\nBasic arithmetic functions\n\nlog2(x) # logarithms base 2 of x\nlog10(x) # logaritms base 10 of x\nexp(x) # Exponential of x\nabs(x) # absolute value of x\nsqrt(x) # square root of x\n\n\n\nAssigning values to variables\nA variable can be used to store a value.\nFor example, the R code below will store the day of year (DOY) in a variable as “DOY”:\n\n# Day of year (DOY) is 1 (i.e., Jan 1st)\nDOY &lt;- 1\n\n# You can also use this notation, but it is more frequent when using R to use the above notation\nDOY = 1\n\nNote that, it’s possible to use &lt;- or = for variable assignments (athough as noted above, &lt;- is more common)\nTo print the value of the created object, just type its name:\n\nDOY\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nor use the function print() (you’ll see later use you use the function cat() to display output):\n\nprint(DOY)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nYou can also perform basic arithmetic using your variable\n\nDOY + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nYou can change the value of the object:\n\n# Change the value\nDOY &lt;- 365\n# Print again\nDOY\n\n[1] 365\n\n\nYou can also write equations using previously defined variables. The following R code creates two variables including the width and the height of a rectangle. These two variables will be used to compute the area of the rectangle.\n\n# Rectangle height\nheight &lt;- 10\n# rectangle width\nwidth &lt;- 5\n# compute rectangle area\narea &lt;- height*width\nprint(area)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n\nBasic data types\nBasic data types are numeric, character and logical.\n\n# Numeric object: How old are you?\nmy_age &lt;- 28\n# Character  object: What's your name?\nmy_name &lt;- \"Jane\"\n# logical object: Are you a data scientist?\n# (yes/no) &lt;=&gt; (TRUE/FALSE)\nis_datascientist &lt;- TRUE\n\nIt’s possible to use the function class() to see what type a variable is:\n\nclass(my_age)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nclass(my_name)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nYou can also use the functions is.numeric(), is.character(), is.logical() to check whether a variable is numeric, character or logical, respectively. For instance:\n\nis.numeric(my_age)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nis.numeric(my_name)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIf you want to change the type of a variable to another one, use the as.* functions, including: as.numeric(), as.character(), as.logical(), etc.\n\nmy_age\n\n[1] 28\n\n\n\n# Convert my_age to a character variable\nas.character(my_age)\n\n[1] \"28\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nA vector is a combination of multiple values (numeric, character or logical) in the same object. In this case, you can have numeric vectors, character vectors or logical vectors.\n\nCreate a vector\nA vector is created using the function c() (for concatenate), as follow:\n\n# Create a vector that includes multiple DOY values\nDOY &lt;- c(1,81,172,365) # the c() function creates a vector\nDOY # This outputs the vector\n\n[1]   1  81 172 365\n\n\nNote: a vector can only hold elements of the same type. For example, you cannot have a vector that contains both characters and numeric values.\nFind the length of a vector (i.e., the number of elements in a vector)\n\n# Create a vector that includes multiple DOY values\nlength(DOY)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nCase of missing values\nIn R missing values (or missing information) are represented by NA:\n\n# Create a vector that includes multiple DOY values and assume we don't know one of the values\nDOY_with_NA &lt;- c(1,81,NA,365) # note the new variable name as to note overwrite the variable DOY\nDOY_with_NA # This outputs the vector\n\n[1]   1  81  NA 365\n\n\nIt’s possible to use the function is.na() to check whether a data contains missing value. The result of the function is.na() is a logical vector in which, the value TRUE specifies that the corresponding element in x is NA.\n\nis.na(DOY_with_NA)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n\nGet a subset of a vector\nSubsetting a vector consists of selecting a part of your vector.\nSelection by positive indexing: select an element of a vector by its position (index) in square brackets\n\n# Select DOY number 2\nDOY[2]\n\n[1] 81\n\n\n\n# Select DOY number 1 to 3\nDOY[1:3]\n\n[1]   1  81 172\n\n\nSelection by negative indexing: Exclude an element\n\n# Exclude DOY number 2\nDOY[-2]\n\n[1]   1 172 365\n\n\n\n# Exclude DOY number 1 and 3\nDOY[-c(1,3)]\n\n[1]  81 365\n\n\nFor more on subsetting vectors, see here\n\n\n\nCalculations with vectors\nNote that, all the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, / and ^ ) as well as the common arithmetic functions (log, exp, sin, cos, tan, sqrt, abs, …), described in the previous sections, can be applied on a numeric vector.\nIf you perform an operation with vectors, the operation will be applied to each element of the vector. An example is provided below:\n\n# The declination angle (defined as delta below) can be estimated using the simplified equation in Topic 4, Slide 7\ndelta &lt;- -23.4*cos(2*pi*(DOY+10)/365)\ndelta\n\n[1] -22.9817392  -0.1007028  23.3991332 -23.0541505\n\n\nOther useful functions are:\n\nmax(x) # Get the maximum value of x\nmin(x) # Get the minimum value of x\n# Get the range of x. Returns a vector containing\n# the minimum and the maximum of x\nrange(x) \n   \nlength(x) # Get the number of elements in x\n  \nsum(x) # Get the total of the elements in x\n  \nprod(x) # Get the product of the elements in x\n \n# The mean value of the elements in x\n# sum(x)/length(x)\nmean(x) \nsd(x) # Standard deviation of x\nvar(x) # Variance of x\n# Sort the element of x in ascending order\nsort(x)\n\n\n\nData frames\nWhen you load a dataset, it will generally be loaded as a data frame (e.g., the datasets you will be loading for your Assignments). However, here are some simple examples to help you get more familiar with data frames.\n\nCreate a data frame\nA data frame can be created using the function data.frame(), as follow:\n\n# Create a data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  DOY = c(1,81,172,365),\n  albedo = c(0.4,0.1,0.34,0.9),\n  Qh = c(10,400,350,-40)\n)\n# Print\ndf\n\n  DOY albedo  Qh\n1   1   0.40  10\n2  81   0.10 400\n3 172   0.34 350\n4 365   0.90 -40\n\n\nTo check whether a data is a data frame, use the is.data.frame() function. Returns TRUE if the data is a data frame:\n\nis.data.frame(df)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nSubset a data frame\nTo select just certain columns from a data frame, you can either refer to the columns by name or by their location (i.e., column 1, 2, 3, etc.).\nPositive indexing by name and by location\n\n# Access the data in 'DOY' column\n# dollar sign is used\ndf$DOY\n\n[1]   1  81 172 365\n\n\n\n# or use this\ndf[, 'DOY']\n\n[1]   1  81 172 365\n\n\n\n# Subset columns 1 and 3\ndf[, c(1,3)]\n\n  DOY  Qh\n1   1  10\n2  81 400\n3 172 350\n4 365 -40\n\n\nFor more on subsetting a data frame see here. On this page you can also find more opperations you can perform using data frames.\n\n\n\nInstalling packages\nNote that while you will not need to install packages when using RStudio Server (since they are pre-installed), this is helpful if you need to install packages using R installed on your own computer.\nTo install an R package, we can use the install.packages() function:\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nor you can install multiple packages using\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\",\"tidyverse\")\n\nNow when you need to use a package in an Assignment or Study Question, you can call it using\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nPlotting data\nHere we will use the packe ggplot to create some basic plots.\nUse the R code below:\n\n#### Install and load ggplot2 package\n\n# Installation \ninstall.packages('ggplot2') \n#NOTE: You only need to install a package once. Once it is installed, you can comment it out by adding # in front of it (e.g., # install.packages('ggplot2') )\n\n# Loading the package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nData format and preparation\nThe data set mtcars is used in the examples below:\n\n# Load the data\ndata(mtcars)\ndf &lt;- mtcars[, c(\"mpg\", \"cyl\", \"wt\")]\n# Convert cyl to a factor variable\ndf$cyl &lt;- as.factor(df$cyl)\nhead(df)\n\n                   mpg cyl    wt\nMazda RX4         21.0   6 2.620\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6 2.875\nDatsun 710        22.8   4 2.320\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6 3.215\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8 3.440\nValiant           18.1   6 3.460\n\n\nggplot(): build plots piece by piece\nThis section describes briefly how to use the function ggplot(). Recall that, the concept of ggplot divides a plot into three different fundamental parts: plot = data + Aesthetics + geometry.\n\ndata: a data frame.\nAesthetics: used to specify x and y variables, color, size, shape, ….\nGeometry: the type of plots (histogram, boxplot, line, density, dotplot, bar, …)\n\nTo demonstrate how the function ggplot() works, we’ll draw a scatter plot. The function aes() is used to specify aesthetics.\n\n# Basic scatter plot\nggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the point size, and shape\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How would you convert this to a line graph? Try asking chatgpt (or equivalent) ;)\n\n\n\nInstructions for Loading Excel and CSV files in R Markdown\n\nUpload the file of interest to the folder of interest (see details in RStudio Server page)\nInstall required packages: Use the following code to install the necessary packages for reading Excel and CSV files:\n\n\n# Note that you only need to install a package once\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")    \ninstall.packages(\"readr\")     \n\n\nLoad Required Libraries: Include a code chunk in your R Markdown file to load the libraries:\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\nRead an xlsx file: Use the read_excel function from the readxl package. Specify the path to your Excel file:\n\n\n# Example of reading an Excel file\ndata_xlsx &lt;- read_excel(\"path/to/your/file.xlsx\", sheet = 1)\nhead(data_xlsx)  # View the first few rows\n\n\nRead a CSV file: Use the read_csv function from the readr package. Specify the path to your CSV file:\n\n\n# Example of reading a CSV file\ndata_csv &lt;- read_csv(\"path/to/your/file.csv\")\nhead(data_csv)  # View the first few rows\n\nNotes:\n\nReplace “path/to/your/file.xlsx” and “path/to/your/file.csv” with the actual paths to your files.\nIf your file is in the working directory, you can use just the file name instead of the full path.\nFor Excel files with multiple sheets, use the sheet argument in read_excel to specify the sheet name or index.\n\n\n\nHandling Dates in R\nNote: this goes beyond the basics and provides more in depth information on handling of dates in R for those that are curious/interested.\nR has multiple packages to handle dates, including base R, lubridate, and chron. The most commonly used is lubridate (part of the tidyverse).\n\nWorking with dates in base R\n\n\nConvert a string to a date\n\n\n# Using as.Date\ndate1 &lt;- as.Date(\"2025-01-01\") # Output: \"2025-01-01\"\n\n\nSpecify a format\n\n\ndate2 &lt;- as.Date(\"01-01-2025\", format = \"%d-%m-%Y\") # Output: \"2025-01-01\"\n\n\nDate arithmetic\n\n\n# Add or subtract days\ndate1 + 5  # Adds 5 days\ndate1 - 7  # Subtracts 7 days\n\n# Difference between two dates\ndiff &lt;- as.Date(\"2025-01-10\") - date1 # Output: 9 days\n\n\nGet the current date\n\n\nSys.Date()\n\n\nUsing the lubridate package\n\nInstall the package if needed:\n\ninstall.packages(\"lubridate\")\n\n\nParsing dates\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Automatically detect formats\ndate3 &lt;- ymd(\"20250101\")   # \"2025-01-01\"\ndate4 &lt;- dmy(\"01-01-2025\") # \"2025-01-01\"\n\n\nExtract date components\n\n\nyear(date3)    # 2025\nmonth(date3)   # 1\nday(date3)     # 1\n\n\nWork with time\n\n\ntime &lt;- ymd_hms(\"2025-01-01 10:30:00\")\nhour(time)     # 10\nminute(time)   # 30\nsecond(time)   # 0\n\nCommon date formats\n\n%Y: Year (4 digits, e.g., 2025)\n%y: Year (2 digits, e.g., 25)\n%m: Month (numeric, e.g., 01)\n%B: Month (full name, e.g., January)\n%d: Day of the month (e.g., 01)\n%H: Hour (24-hour clock, e.g., 13)\n%M: Minute\n%S: Second",

Each assignment is worth 14% of your final grade.\nCollaboration on homework is encouraged. However, you should think about the problems yourself before discussing them with others. Also, write-ups must be done independently.

    "text": "GEOG 321: Winter 2025\n\n\nHow do feedbacks between ecosystems and the atmosphere influence microclimates and the global climate system? In this course we’ll focus on the interactions between the surface, vegetation and atmosphere, and the physical processes governing the transfer of heat, mass and momentum. Through this course you’ll also be exposed to the basic instrumentation and methods used in today’s monitoring and modeling of microscale climate and surface-atmosphere exchange. While this course examines the behaviour of the atmosphere close to the surface, what we cover in this class implications for processes occurring at the scale of a single leaf to the entire planet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nexplain how the surface radiation and energy budget affects the surface climate.\ndescribe important surface characteristics that affect surface radiation and energy budgets and surface microclimates.\nunderstand the basics of turbulence, dispersion and local wind systems in the atmospheric boundary layer and how they are controlled by surface processes.\nprovide examples of key physical, biological and chemical processes that control trace gas, water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere.\nprovide examples of how surface-atmosphere interactions respond to environmental change, and how this can create climate feedbacks.\nknow the principles of basic instrumentation, methods and data-analysis (including the use of the R programming language) used for today’s monitoring and modelling of weather and climate in the atmospheric boundary layer.\nanalyze and interpret data from measurement systems that are used to monitor near-surface climate and surface radiation, energy, and greenhouse gas balances.\nexplain how the principles of micrometeorology have practical applications to society.\n\n\n\nYour Instructor\nDr. Sara Knox\n\n\n\n\nPronouns: She/Her/Hers\nEmail: sara.knox@mcgill.ca\nOffice Hours: Mondays 10:00-11:00 in BH 619. Alternative times available by appointment\nBio: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography. Prior to that I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at UBC between Jan 2019 & June 2023. I received my BSc in Earth System Science from McGill in 2009, and my PhD in Environmental Science from UC Berkeley in 2019. I am broadly interested in the impacts of climate variability and land-use change on land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy, and trace gases. I also seek to understand how ecosystem responses to global change can feedback to slow or accelerate future climate change. My research and training is in micrometeorology, hydrology, and ecosystem ecology. I focus on biosphere-atmosphere interactions in a variety of climates and ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nTAs and TA office hours\nYour TA for the class is Camille Jones (camille.jones@mail.mcgill.ca).\nCamille will hold two office hours per assignment to assist you with each assignment. The office hours are:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Dates & locations of TA office hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1\nAssignment 2\nAssignment 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructional methods\nThe course consists of two 80-minute lectures each week and one lab visits covering 32 topics, directed readings, assignments, study questions, a midterm during the semester and a final during the exam period.\nLectures will be held in-person. Lectures will also be recorded and can be made available upon request. Note that if you do not attend lecture, you will not receive participation marks for that day, however, each student can miss up to three lectures without it impacting their participation grade. If you miss a lecture due to medical or other reasons, please reach out to me, and I can provide you with a recording of the lecture. If you miss more than 3 lectures, contact me regarding your absences and we can assess potential accommodations.\n\n\nCommunication Guidelines\n\nAnnouncements\nNew announcements will be posted regularly to keep you informed of logistics and any important course updates. Please make sure to check frequently.\n\n\nEmail\nWhile I encourage you to post course content related questions in the Discussion Forums (see below), for private communication, use email. Please put the course ID {GEOG 321} on the subject line. Emails are typically answered within 24-48 hours during regular business hours (M-F 9am-5pm). When addressing me in your email, you can refer to me as either Sara, Dr. Knox or Prof. Knox. Remember that email is a formal and public method of communication. Do not write anything that you do not want on the permanent, public record.\n\n\nCourse Logistics Q & A Forum\nUse this forum to ask logistical questions about the course or report any problems you encounter. Your classmates may have the same question. Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other!\nThe TAs and I will check this Forum every few days.\n\n\nOther Discussion Forums\nDiscussion Forums are available for any questions related to assignments and study questions as well as the lecture material. As noted above, your classmates may have the same question. Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other!\n\n\n\nRequired course materials\nThe readings are posted on the course website. They consist of draft chapters from the textbook ‘Boundary Layer Climates’ by T. R. Oke and a few other sources.\n\n\nCourse content\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Schedule for lectures, readings and assignments. Note: All dates and topics are still subject to change. Please make sure to regularly check the website for updates to the schedule.

Note that you do not need to have the correct answer to receive full marks, you just need to submit an answer to the questions during the lecture. You are also strongly encouraged to engage in all discussion questions on Slido.\nAssignments will be handed on myCourses on the due date. All assignments are required to be labelled with course number, student number, student name and assignment number. Late assignments will be penalized 10% of the actual marks achieved for each (partial) day past 11:59 pm on the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted once graded assignments have been returned to the class (which results in a grade of 0%). Note that you are not required to use R (or other programming languages) for assignments, however, it is encouraged, and I will provide support and resources to help you with that (see Coding resources on the course website). Each assignment is worth 14% of your final grade.\nCollaboration on homework is encouraged. However, you should think about the problems yourself before discussing them with others. Also, write-ups must be done independently. (In practice, this means that it is OK for other people to explain their solutions to you, but you must not be looking at other people’s solutions as you write your own.)\nSelf-study questions questions are assigned regularly throughout the semester (9 in total). These are a great opportunity for you to apply some of the concepts covered in class and will help prepare you for assignments and exams. It is also a helpful way for you to learn R if that is of interest to you. Note that while solutions to the self-study questions are available to you, you are required to upload your own answers to these questions on myCourses (either as a word document, pdf, or html file). To help you keep up with the course material, you will have a week to upload your answers to myCourses (note that they are due at 11:59pm ET on that day). You only need to complete 7/9 to receive full marks for the self-study questions (4% of your total grade). Note that late study questions will receive a grade of zero. All self-study questions and their due dates are already posted under Assignments.\nThe mid-term exam will be a closed-book, in-person exam on Wednesday, February 29th during class. More details on the mid-term exam can be found on the course website\nThe final exam will be held during the final exam period. It will also be a closed-book, in-person exam. The duration of the final is 3 hours (180 minutes). Additional details on the final exam will be posted on the course website.\nNote: Illness and extenuating circumstances can happen and may be legitimate reasons for extensions on assignments or postponement of exams. If there are reasons you are unable to meet a deadline be sure to discuss with me well in advance if possible. You must be prepared to provide confirmation of illness.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nMcGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures” (Approved by Senate on 29 January 2003) (See McGill’s guide to academic honesty for more information).\n\n\nOther statements\nPlease see the full course syllabus.\n\n\nStrategies for Success\nBe proactive!\n\nKeep track of deadlines & note the late submission policies\n\nTimely communication is important! If you have an issue, please bring it to my attention.\nPartial credit is better than no credit. If you can’t finish a lab before the deadline - just submit what you’ve got done already.\n\nDrop by office hours & ask questions!",

For example you should know if a variable is linearly proportional or inversely proportional to another variable (a possible multiple-choice question) and what the constant of proportionality is called (a possible short-answer question). You should have some ideas about the typical range of variables in the atmosphere and the order of magnitude of constants rather than their exact value.\n\n\nCan I use a calculator?\nYes, although the questions are designed to be completed without needing one.\nWhich equations should I focus on?\n\nEnergy fluxes at Earth’s surface – ideal surface: \\(Q* = Q_{H} + Q_{E} + Q_{G}\\) (Topic 3)\nCosine law of illumination: \\(S = S_{i}cosZ\\) (Topic 4)\nConservation of incident radiation: \\(\\psi_{\\lambda} + \\alpha_{\\lambda} + \\zeta_{\\lambda} = 1\\) (Topic 5 & 7)\nSpectral reflectivity: \\(\\alpha_{\\lambda}\\) = Radiation reflected/Radiation incident (Topic 6)\nAlbedo: = \\(K\\uparrow/K\\downarrow\\)\nStefan-Boltzmann’s law: \\(E = \\sigma T_{0}^{4}\\) (and \\(E = \\sigma \\varepsilon T_{0}^{4}\\)) (Topic 7)\nKirchhoff’s law: \\(\\zeta_{\\lambda} = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}\\) (Topic 7)\nNet longwave radiation: \\(L* = L\\downarrow - L\\uparrow = L\\downarrow - (\\varepsilon_{o}T_{o}^{4} +(1-\\varepsilon_{o}))L\\downarrow)\\) (Topic 8)\nNet (absorbed) solar: \\(K* = K\\downarrow - K\\uparrow = K\\downarrow(1 -\\alpha)\\) (Topic 8)\nNet all-wave radiation: \\(Q* = K* + L * = K\\downarrow(1 -\\alpha) + \\varepsilon_{o}L\\downarrow - \\varepsilon_{o}T_{o}^{4}\\) (Topic 8)\nThe heat capacity of a mixture: \\(C_{s} = C_{m}\\theta_{m}+C_{o}\\theta_{o}+C_{w}\\theta_{w}+C_{a}\\theta_{a}\\) (Topic 10)\nRate of temperature change in a soil: \\(\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{C_{s}}\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta z}\\) (Topic 10)\nFourier’s law: \\(Q_{G} = -k\\Delta T/\\Delta z = -k(T_{2}-T_{1})/(z_{2}-z_{1})\\) (Topic 10 & 11)\nThermal diffusivity: \\(\\kappa = k/C\\) (Topic 10)\nThermal admittance: \\(\\mu = (kC)^{1/2}\\) (Topic 11)\nDamping depth: \\(D=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\omega}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa P}{\\pi}}\\) (Topic 12)\nBeer’s law: \\(I_{\\lambda(z)} = I_{\\lambda(o)}e^{-kz}\\) (Topic 13)\nThe energy balance of snow and ice: \\(Q* = Q_{H} + Q_{s} + Q_{M}\\)\nSensible heat flux through LBL: \\(Q_{H} = C_{a}(T_{0} -T_{a})/r_{b}\\) (Topic 15)\nWater vapour flux through LBL: \\(Q_{E} = L_{v}(\\rho_{vo}-\\rho_{va})/r_{b}\\) (Topic 15)\nReynold’s number: \\(Re = \\frac{\\mu d}{\\nu}\\) (Topic 16)\nReynold’s decomposition: \\(a(t) = a'(t) - \\overline{a}\\) (Lecture 18)\nThe variance of \\(a\\) (variable of interest) in a turbulent time series: \\(\\overline{a^{'2}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i = 0}^{N-1}{a^{'2}(t_{i},x_{0})}\\) (Lecture 18)\nThe standard deviation of a (variable of interest) in a turbulent time series: \\(\\sigma_{a} = \\sqrt{\\overline{a^{'2}}}\\)\nTurbulence intensities: (Lecture 18) \\(I_{u} = \\sigma_{u}/M\\) \\(I_{v} = \\sigma_{v}/M\\) \\(I_{w} = \\sigma_{w}/M\\) \\(M = \\sqrt{\\overline{u}^{2}+\\overline{v}^{2}+\\overline{w}^{2}}\\)\nReynolds stress: \\(\\tau = -\\rho{\\overline{u'w'}}\\) (Lecture 19)\nFriction velocity: \\(u_{*} = \\sqrt{-\\overline{u'w'}}\\) (Lecture 19)\nThe logarithmic wind law: \\(\\overline{u}_{(z)} = \\frac{u_{*}}{k}ln\\frac{z}{z_{0}}\\) or if we include the zero-plane displacement (\\(z_{d}\\)) \\(\\overline{u}_{(z)} = \\frac{u_{*}}{k}ln\\frac{z-z_{d}}{z_{0}}\\) (Lecture 20)\nEstimate of the roughness length (\\(z_{0}\\)): \\(z_{0} \\approx 0.1z_{h}\\) (Lecture 20)\n\n\n\nAre there examples from previous years?\nYes. There are midterms from previous year, which have similar types of questions and overall structure. You can solve midterms from 2014, 2013, 2011, and 2010 and check your answers using the answer keys for 2014, 2013, 2011, and 2010. Note that you may not be able to answer all questions with your background. The order of topics has changed slightly from previous years when this course was taught by another instructor. Also note that lectures and slides referenced in the answer keys may no longer align with this year’s version of the course."
