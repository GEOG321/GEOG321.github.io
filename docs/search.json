    "text": "GEOG 321: Winter 2024\nwith Dr. Sara Knox\nHow do feedbacks between ecosystems and the atmosphere influence microclimates and the global climate system? In this course we’ll focus on the interactions between the surface, vegetation and atmosphere, and the physical processes governing the transfer of heat, mass and momentum. Through this course you’ll also be exposed to the basic instrumentation and methods used in today’s monitoring and modeling of microscale climate and surface-atmosphere exchange. While this course examines the behaviour of the atmosphere close to the surface, what we cover in this class implications for processes occurring at the scale of a single leaf to the entire planet!\n\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nexplain how the surface radiation and energy budget affects the surface climate.\ndescribe important surface characteristics that affect surface radiation and energy budgets and surface microclimates.\nunderstand the basics of turbulence, dispersion and local wind systems in the atmospheric boundary layer and how they are controlled by surface processes.\nDescribe interactions between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and to understand how surface-atmosphere feedbacks respond to environmental change.\nknow the principles of basic instrumentation, methods and data-analysis (including the use of the R programming language) used for today’s monitoring and modelling of weather and climate in the atmospheric boundary layer.\nanalyze and interpret data from measurement systems that are used to monitor near-surface climate and surface radiation and energy balances.\nexplain how the principles of micrometeorology have practical application to society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Instructor\nDr. Sara Knox\n\n\n\n\nPronouns: She/Her/Hers\nEmail: sara.knox@mcgill.ca\nOffice Hours: ?var:instructor.office"
